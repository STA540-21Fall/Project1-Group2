# Background, motivation, objective

At the beginning of our project we wanted to see if socio-economic factors had any influence on the impact Covid. Some original ideas for socio-economic data to use included looking at unemployment, education scores, public assistance percentages and median income. We also looked how to quantify the effect of covid, which could be measured through hospitalizations, deaths or cases. We ultimately decided to use median-income alongside case per capita for our socio-economic analysis due to the availability of quality data for all US counties. We also decided to include political voting information as it was decided that a trend between covid cases and political voting was likely.

The overall objective of our project was to use visualizations to look at Covid-19 case data on a county level and see if there was any connection between median income or democrat voting percentage and the Covid cases per 1000 people. 

# Data acquiring and cleaning

  We obtained our data from many different sources. The county-level Covid-19 cases data came from the New York Times. The median income data was obtained from the U.S. bureau of labor statistics.  The urbanization index was gathered from the National Center for Health Statistics and the political voting data was access from Tony McGovern's public github. We chose to use the percentage of people who voted for Democrats in each county to make the data consistent. For further analysis, we also decided to include the region each county belongs based upon their Census region designation.

  In order to merge datasets together we used county FIPS code, a 5 digit code used by the federal government to numerically identify counties. Using FIPS code is safer than county and state names because some states have same county names. Unfortunately, county FIPS codes have different formats in different datasets, as there have been multiple editions of the FIPS code system. After standardizing the FIPS code a merge became much easier. However, In the Covid case data, some observations had missing FIPS Codes. Most of these observations have unknown county names and were ultimately ignored. There were also two counties with missing FIPS code: Joplin and Kansas City in Missouri. Since the information of these two counties are also missing in other datasets, we decided to exclude them. 
  
  The other issue in the case data was that New York City was considered a single county despite consisting of five counties. Thus, we decided to combine the information from counties in New York City together in the datasets other than case data. For household median income and geographic data, we calculated the average.

In order to get the 7-day average for the three peaks we picked, we first created the variable that indicates which peak each day is in. Then ,we excluded the observations that are not recorded in the peaks. Since we have cumulative cases in the data, we calculated the 7-day average by $\frac{\max cases - \min cases}{7}$. 

Finally, we created a year variable by peak information and merged all the datasets into the final dataset. Here is the information of our final dataset.
